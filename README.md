Dear Joe,

If you want to sort numbers bubble sort style, you'd want to look at the first number and compare it to the number next to it. If your number you're currently on is higher, swap places with it. You would wanna do that until you reach the end. Once you reach the end of the number list, start all over again and do the same thing all over until you go through the list without having to do any swapping.
